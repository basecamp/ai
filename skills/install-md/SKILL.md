# install-md

Open `@references/guide.md` and follow it. Do not proceed without it.

Create install.md files that AI agents can execute autonomously. The output enables agents to install software without human intervention.

The guide contains:
- Spec requirements for autonomous execution
- Drafting process with validation gates
- 12 eval checks with pass criteria
- Failure modes from real-world friction
