# skill-crafting

Open `@references/guide.md` and follow it. Do not proceed without it.

Create effective agent skills through iterative co-development. The skill and its outputs improve together until outputs graduate to exemplars.

The guide contains:
- The co-development flywheel
- Bootstrapping without exemplars
- Eval loop mechanics
- Structure emergence
- Maturity signals
